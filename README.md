Homework Challenge 21

First, definitions:

A proper divisor of a number is any number that divides it exactly other than the number itself. Note that 1 is a proper divisor of all numbers.
An untouchable number is one that is NOT the sum of the proper divisors of any number.
Some examples:

2 is untouchable
3 is not untouchable because it is the sum of the proper divisors of 4 (1 and 2)
4 is not untouchable because it is the sum of the proper divisors of 9 (1 and 3)
5 is untouchable
6 is not untouchable as it is the sum of its own proper divisors, i.e. it is perfect.
Task:

Write a program that will produce all the untouchable numbers less than 1000.
