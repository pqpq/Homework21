Homework Challenge 21

First, definitions:

A proper divisor of a number is any number that divides it exactly other than the number itself. <br>
Note that 1 is a proper divisor of all numbers.<br>
An untouchable number is one that is NOT the sum of the proper divisors of any number.<br>
Some examples:<br>
<br>
2 is untouchable<br>
3 is not untouchable because it is the sum of the proper divisors of 4 (1 and 2)<br>
4 is not untouchable because it is the sum of the proper divisors of 9 (1 and 3)<br>
5 is untouchable<br>
6 is not untouchable as it is the sum of its own proper divisors, i.e. it is perfect.<br>
<br>
Task: write a program that will produce all the untouchable numbers less than 1000.
